You have been provided a comma separated value (.csv) file. This data set should remain unedited.  Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is as follows:
•	Create a single web page in asp.net C# with a textbox and a button that, when clicked, searches a given dataset and returns the entire record of results on screen
•	Include a drop down that defaults to all columns but can be selected to search only one column
•	Provide error checking where appropriate
•	If you have the talent and time, you may style the page.  You will be evaluated on functionality not UI design.

Additional Requests:
•	Please use a Database (SQLite or In-Memory) is sufficient
•	Please use Entity Framework to serve the data
•	This is to showcase your code, organization, and standards please showcase them to the team
•	Your project should work on any developer’s machine when turned in as long as they have Visual Studio as a web application.  If it doesn’t work you won’t pass.
•	Provide a writeup about your project.  What was your approach. Provide things that you might change about the project if given the opportunity.  Observations you made to improve the page.  Length of time spent coding the application.
•	Focus on how a user would use the application

User Story for the project:
As a sports announcer I would like to search for football teams and see their records during a game day announcement.
